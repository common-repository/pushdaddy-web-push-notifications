== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I need PushDaddy account to use this plugin? =

= It doesn't seem to work, I can't see any opt-in prompt or javascript code. =
If you are using W3 Total Cache, SuperCache or any other cache plugin, you would need to first purge the cache once after the plugin has been configured. CloudFlare or any other CDN must also be purged once for the plugin to work.

= Can PushDaddy work on HTTP websites? =
